# SchemaFiles

The [XML Schema Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)) files from the (current) two important models - the RFDevice and the GeoLocalizationResult.
The idea is, you can use this files to create classes (with the appropriate tools) for different programming languages from the RFDevice (or GeoLocalizationResult) to have the same properties or fields.
